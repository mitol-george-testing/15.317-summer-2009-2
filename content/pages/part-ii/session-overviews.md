| 5 | Leading transformational change | This session will focus on leading transformational change, especially from the middle of organizations. We will once again follow the format laid out for Ses #8. Hence, we will need volunteers to share their experiences. |
| 6 | A reflection of your LGO leadership journey | For our final class, you will have an opportunity to showcase your LGO leadership experiences. We have invited the LGO co-directors and representatives from the [MIT Leadership Center](http://mitleadership.mit.edu/) at Sloan and the [Gordon Leadership Program](http://web.mit.edu/gordonelp/) to come to class and hear first hand from you what you have learned from your two-year leadership journey. The goal for the session is to share what LGO is doing and help our invited guests think about whether and perhaps how the LGO approach can be adapted to teach leadership to other MIT student groups and programs.
